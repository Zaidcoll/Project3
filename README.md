# CODE INSTITUTE PROJECT 3 - SECRET RECIPE
Ever craved for a fast food in the middle of the night but realized it has already closed? Fret not! Secret Recipe will teach you how to make your own fast food at the comfort of your home; at anytime, anywhere.

You can view the website via  [Here!](https://secret-recipe.herokuapp.com/)

# USER INTERFACE
I have design the website with the intent of making it very user friendly with buttons as directions to different pages. User is able to view the whole recipe at the convenience of up to 3 clicks. Furthermore, there is 3 different navigation bar links which further simplify the simplicity concept.

# FEATURES
As of recipe websites, I want the user to be able to see, filter and even share their own recipe to the liking. 

#  ALL RECIPES
>By clicking on the navigation button or the hero image button, the visitor will be able to view all the recipes that is being shared in the website. 

# ADD RECIPE
>Visitors to the site are able to share existing recipes of fast food items to enable others to enjoy fast food at the comfort of their home.

# FILTER
>I have included a filter by which visitors are able to click and find all the available recipes for their desired fast food chain.

# Upcoming features to implement
Before presenting this project to possible employers, few things I would like to add. 
- Ability to rate the recipe to enable those who have try the recipe evaluate is it good enough to be on par with the original recipe.
- Search function which enables to quickly filter the recipe by name ( if the community has been actively share their own recipes)
- Videos Tutorial which would be a walkthrough so that beginners are able to start cooking their favourite fast food dish.

# Technology Used
- ## HTML / CSS
Basic html is used to build the structure of the website
CSS for simple styling

- ## MATERIALIZE
A css framework which further improves the aesthetics of the website.

- ## Flask
A python framework which enables one to quickly build websites using python.

- ## MONGODB
A non SQL database which I use to store and retrieve data from the database

- ## JINJA2
Enables me to write python code on html script.

- ## Jquery
Enable one to do simple DOM manipulation without using the hassle of vanilla javascript.

- ## Git
Version control. Enable to revisit the commit history to see changes in projects. 

- ## Heroku
Enables me to deploy my website in the cloud!

# Testing
- # Forms
Since it is a site which will link to database, I did most of my time linking up the correct parameters with the ones in the database to ensure that correct data is being retrieved and sent back to their corresponding ids.

- # Navbar
Making sure the different links and buttons work properly, linking to designated pages.

- # Filter button
Enable the correct corresponding categories being shown when user clicks on the desired fast food chain when clicking on the button.

# Deployment
This website was deployed to Heroku which enables evelopers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. I used gunicorn which is a webserver which is more powerful than the given webserver given by Flask which scales much better given the higher traffic. You can visit the site at (https://secret-recipe.herokuapp.com/).
